Triggering a Render:
React triggers a render mainly in 2 ways:
a) Rendering an index.js which gets executed when we run our application.
b) When we change state/props of a component, React triggers a render (re-render that component).

1. Rendering: 
Updating UI (or) calling a component.
It has 4 stages:
i) Creating a new Virtual DOM
ii) Reconciliation / React Fiber
iii) Diffing Algorithm
iv) Committing changes to Actual DOM.

i) Creating a new Virtual DOM:
Every time React triggers a render, it also creates a new Virtual DOM.

ii) Reconciliation / React Fiber:
It is an algorithm/process used by React to compare two Virtual DOMs.
This process uses "Diffing Algorithm".

iii) Diffing Algorithm:
It is implemented during Reconciliation.

Diffing Algo is used by React to effectively(in minimum no. of steps) identify the changes required to update the actual DOM.
As every time React triggers a render a new Virtual DOM is created and React recursively traverses down the virtual DOM to find the changes:

For React elements that exists in new Virtual DOM & doesn't exist in prev Virtual DOM, it identifies that the corresponding HTML elements has to created and appended to Actual DOM.

For React elements that doesn't in new Virtual DOM but exists in prev Virtual DOM, React identifies that the corresponding HTML elements has to be removed from Actual DOM.

For React elements that exist in both the Virtual DOMs & differ by content, React identifies that the corresponding HTML's content has to be updated.

2. iv) Committing to Actual DOM: At this stage, React DOM updates the Actual DOM according to the changes identified during Reconciliation process. Now, actual DOM is in sync with Virtual DOM.

And the browser recalculates the layout(reflow) and repaints the updated UI on the screen.
