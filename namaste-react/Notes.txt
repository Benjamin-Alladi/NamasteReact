created namaste-react
created index.html, App.js

npm init => Initialiase npm. It creates packagr.json
npm install react
npm install react-dom
npm install -D parcel => Installing "parcel" as a DevDependency. It is a bundler similar to WebPack, Vite.

In App.js, import React from "react" and import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
Now create ReactElement which is a Javascript object.  React.createElement(HTMLTag, Object of Attributes, Array of Children).
Now create root using ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).
root.render(ReactElement).

Now load this script into index.html using "script" tag (type="module").

To run the application in Development Mode => npx parcel index.html;  (Here, We are making index.html as entrypoint. So, remove main:"index.js" from package.json).
To run the application in Production Mode => npx parcel build index.html;
Production Mode is faster than Development Mode.


Now Add this to "scripts" in package.json:
"start": "parcel index.html",
"build": "parcel build index.html",

Run the application in Development Mode => npm run start.
Run the application in Production Mode => npm run build.
